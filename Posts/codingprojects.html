      <br>
      <p> Over time, I have created many coding projects.</p>
      <p> These have included multiple games using a website called scratch; many programs using python on repl.it; a blog found at jackm245.github.io; and much much more!</p>
      <p>If you would like to see any more projects from me, then simply email me! (You can find my email adress in the Contact section at the top).</p>

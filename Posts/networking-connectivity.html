      <h3>Quiz</h3>
      <h4>1.	The main Google <h>server</h> is in the United States. When you use Google to find the answer to a question, what <h>transmission medium</h> is used? (Select from <h>satellite transmission, undersea fibre optic cable, copper telephone cables.)</h>	[1]</h4>
      <p><h>Undersea fibre optic cable</h></p>
      <h4>2.	(a)	Define the term <h>bandwidth.</h> 	[1]</h4>
      <p>The amount of <h>data</h> that can be sent/received at one time<p>
      <h4>(b)	How long would it take to <h>download</h> a <h>700 Megabyte file on a 40Mb connection?</h>	[1]</h4>
      <p>140 seconds ( (700 x 8)/40 )</p>
      <h4>3.	(a)	Explain the difference between <h>uploading</h> and <h>downloading</h> data from the Internet. 	[2]</h4>
      <p><h>Uploading is generally slower</h> and is <h>where information is sent to the internet</h>. Whereas <h>downloading is usually faster</h> and <h>means that things from the internet are put on your computer.</h></p>
      <h4>(b)	Why is <h>uploading generally much slower</h> than downloading?	[2]</h4>
      <p>Uploading is generally slower than downloading because this is <h>what the service provider chooses.</h> They choose for download speed to be greater than the upload speed because <h>more people download items than to upload.</h></p>
      <h4>4.	(a)	Explain what is meant by <h>buffering</h> and why it is used when you download a film from the Internet.	[2]</h4>
      <p>Buffering occurs when the <h>download speed of the file is slower than the play speed</h>, this results in the computer trying to play something that hasn't downloaded, meaning that the user will have to wait for it to download.<p>
      <h4>(b)	Explain why you may sometimes get a message “Loading…” while you are watching a movie online.	[1]</h4>

      <p>This means that the video is <h>buffering</h> and requires the user to wait for the video to download.</p>

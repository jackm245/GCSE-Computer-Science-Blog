      <h1>Networking - Domain Names</h1>
      <h4>What sort of organisation might the <h>website</h> <b>www.survey.gov.uk</b> belong to, and where would it be located?</h4>
      <p>Belong to the UK government and located in the uk</p>
      <h4>Which of the following <h>top-level domain names</h> might a charity use and why? (.com, .org, .gov or .sch)</h4>
      <p>A charity uses .org because it is a non-profitable organisation</p>
      <h4>What is the advantage for a company of a <h>.co.uk address</h>, or a <h>.com address</h>? Why do some companies have both? E.g. Google or Hotmail?</h4>
      <p>These <h>addresses</h> can be used to help people understand whatâ€™s on the <h>website</h>. e.g <h>.org</h> is an  organisation and <h>.co.uk</h> is an english site. If you are just UK based the you only need a <h>.co.uk address</h>, but if you are a bigger company, then you might need a <h>.com</h> and a <h>.co.uk</h></p>

      <h3>Activity 2: IP addresses</h3>
      <h4>All web addresses <h>(URLs)</h> have a corresponding <h>IP address</h>, held on a <h>domain name server (DNS)</h>.
        Use a website such as  http://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-lookup or http://www.who.is  to find out the missing <h>IP addresses</h> and <h>domain names</h>, and where the <h>domain name server</h> is located.</h4>

      <h3>Activity 3: Domain name availability</h3>
       <p>Think of a name that you could use for a website of your own.
        Use a website such as www.uk2.net to search for your domain name to check its availability. You can also see what it might cost to buy.</p>
